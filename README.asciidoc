Project Pacemaker
-----------------

A host - client - system to control 3d printers, CNC milling or laser cutters.

Summary
-------

The https://github.com/JustAnother1/Pacemaker/blob/master/doc/Pacemaker_Protocol.asciidoc[Pacemaker protocol] provides an open interface to allow the separation of real-time and non-real-time control components for 3D printers, CNC machines and laser cutters.

This has the huge benefit of allowing new controller hardware (the real-time component) to work with existing host software solutions (the non-real-time component). This makes it easy to expand the Pacemaker system to new machines.

Pacemaker allows a much richer level of machine control by the non-real-time host software than is possible with typical G-code based systems. This provides feature-rich host software, more integrated start-to-finish tool chain solutions whilst still being able to operate on a wide range of platforms.

Clients
-------

This Project is the Host part of the Pacemaker system. The following clients are available:

- https://github.com/minnow-pmc/Minnow[Minnow]
- https://github.com/JustAnother1/pmc[pmc]

Building and Starting
---------------------

An ant script(build.xml) is provided. With Ant installed building is just:

+$ ant+

The Pacemaker host application can be started like this:

+$ java -jar Pacemaker.jar+

The host needs a configuration file that file can be created manually or by running this:

+$ java -jar PacemakerWizard.jar+

To test the Pacemaker system without real hardware a simulation for the client can be started like this:

+$ java -jar PacemakerTest.jar+
